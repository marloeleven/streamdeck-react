Design structure

Action
  - will try to connect to XBC websocket
     - on load
     - on device connect
     - on app open
     - with interval (if ever websocket server)

Property Inspector


XBC Extension to handle commands
 - or better if we just have an open websocket server available for connection

 - will create streamdeck websocket instance

 - should have a way to send data back to stream deck plugin
 - will receive events and run the command base from data


/**
 CODE


Handlers

XSplithandler
 - handles communication request to XSplit Extension
    - get scenes

AsyncHandler
 - manages callback promises
    - events are namespaced so collisions won't happen

BaseHandler
 - general streamdeck methods

PropertyInspertorHandler
 - extends BaseHandler

PluginHandler
 - extends BaseHandler


/**

const/action -- correspond to manifest

const/events -- correspond to actions in Extension (Elgato Streamdeck like request)




PROBLEM/BUG

 - Inspector request is triggered first before the websocket communication is established
